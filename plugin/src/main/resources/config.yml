# Specify on which server messages will be sent
# Each server needs to specify a delay (in millisecond) to check the presence of a player on the targeted server
#
# For example:
#
#lobby: 1000
#survival: 1000
#mini-game: 2000
#
# is a valid configuration where every message sent on this server will be sent to the server 'lobby', 'survival' and
# 'mini-game'. Those names should match the one specified in the BungeeCord's configuration.
# The plugin will check if it can send the message to the 'lobby' and 'survival' server if the previous check was made
# 1 second ago or more.
# But it will check if it can send the message to the 'mini-game' server only if the previous check was made 2 seconds
# ago.
# Note that if you specify a delay too large, an empty server will stack messages until a player connect. The player
# will then receive the messages, regardless of when they were sent, event if it was several days ago.
# In the opposite way, if you specify a delay to short, the server will not be able to send the message.
# With those considerations, keeping 1000 as a value for every server is probably the best idea
